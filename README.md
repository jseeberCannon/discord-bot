# Introduction:
My name is Jake Seeber and I created a simple Discord bot using Python. The purpose of this bot was to demonstrate my ability and my knowledge of the Python language. Before going into this project my knowledge of Python was very hazy, as I had learned it back in Middle School but hadn’t used it since then. However, since finishing the project I’ve been able to relearn and learn new skills, such as client commands and having two files work together.

# What is the most ambitious feature?
The most ambitious feature my bot has is cogs. Cogs allow for the bot to load and unload certain commands in a server. How the bot does this is from a folder in the same location as the bot file. When loading a cog it will go into that folder and look for the python file with the name of the cog you want to load. Once the cog is loaded you now have access to the commands in that cog. While on paper it seems simple, the process of writing the commands in a cog compared to the bot’s main file is quite different.
